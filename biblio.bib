abstract = {Carbohydrate partitioning is closely coupled with plant growth and architecture, and therefore constitutes an important aspect of the functional-structural modelling of plants. L-PEACH is an L-system-based tree simulation model that combines supply/demand concepts of carbon partitioning with a developmental model of tree architecture. The model is expressed in terms of modules that represent plant organs. An organ may correspond to one or more elementary sources or sinks for carbohydrates. The whole plant is modelled as a branching network of these sources and sinks, connected by conductive elements. An analogy to an electric network is used to calculate the flow and partitioning of carbohydrates between the individual components. It can simulate multiple years of tree growth while capturing the effects of irrigation, crop load and pruning on carbon partitioning and the dynamics of architectural development. The growing tree can be visualized in a schematic or semi-realistic manner, while quantitative data characterizing individual organs, organ types or the whole tree can be output for visualization and analysis to an external program, such as MATLAB.},

This model takes into account realistic physiological rules, the architecture of the plants and their demography. An original benefit of this approach is that it allows the simulation of plant evolution at both functional and life-history levels implementing mutations to the L-systems and a set of genetic parameter values. The conducted experiments focus on the evolutionary emergence of different life history strategies in an environment with heterogeneous resource availability and disturbance frequency. It is found that, depending on the encountered conditions, the plants develop three major strategies classified as competitors, stress-tolerators and ruderals according to Grime's CSR theory. Most of the evolved characteristics comply with theoretical biology or field observations on natural plants. Besides these results, our modelling framework is highly flexible and many refinements can be readily implemented depending on the issues one intends to address. Moreover, the model can readily be used to address many questions at the interface between evolutionary ecology, plant functional and community ecologies and ecosystem ecology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The most common classification of modes of speciation begins with the spatial context in which divergence occurs: sympatric, parapatric or allopatric. This classification is unsatisfactory because it divides a continuum into discrete categories, concentrating attention on the extremes, and it subordinates other dimensions on which speciation processes vary, such as the forces driving differentiation and the genetic basis ofreproductive isolation. It also ignores the fact that speciation is a prolonged process that commonly has phases in different spatial contexts. We use the example of local adaptation and partial reproductive isolation in the intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis to illustrate the inadequacy of the spatial classification of speciation modes. Parallel divergence in shell form in response to similar environmental gradients in England, Spain and Sweden makes this an excellent model system. However, attempts to demonstrate ‘incipient' and ‘sympatric' speciation involve speculation about the future and the past. We suggest that it is more productive to study the current balance between local adaptation and gene flow, the interaction between components of reproductive isolation and the genetic basis of differentiation.},

abstract = {Genetic spaces are often described in terms of fitness landscapes or genotype-to- phenotype maps, where each potential genetic sequence is associated with a set of properties and connected to other genotypes that are a single mutation away. The positions close to a genotype make up its mutational landscape and, in aggregate, determine the short-term evolutionary potential of a population. Populations with wider ranges of phenotypes in their mutational neighborhood tend to be more evolvable. Likewise, those with fewer phenotypic changes available in their local neighborhoods are more mutationally robust. As such, forces that alter the distribution of phenotypes available by mutation can have a profound effect on subsequent evolutionary dynamics. We demonstrate that cyclically-changing environments can push populations toward more evolvable mutational landscapes where a wide range of alternate phenotypes are available, though purely deleterious mutations remain suppressed. We further show that populations in environments with drastic changes shift phenotypes more readily than those in environments with more benign changes. We trace this effect to repeated population bottlenecks in the harsh environments, which result in shorter coalescence times and keep populations in regions of the mutational landscape where the phenotypic shifts in question are more likely to occur.},

Experiments aimed at evolving Sims-type walkers resulted in the emergence of various realistic gaits while using fairly simple objective functions. Due to the flexibility of the system, drastically different morphologies and functions evolved with only minor modifications to the system and objective function. For example, various throwing techniques evolved when selecting for catapults that propel a block as far as possible. Among the strategies and morphologies evolved, we find the drop-kick strategy, as well as the systematic invention of the principle behind the wheel, when allowing mutations to the projectile.},

This paper suggests a more fundamental problem with co-evolving both the morphology and control of virtual creatures simul-taneously – one cemented in the theory of embodied cogni-tion. We reproduce and explore in greater detail a previous finding in the literature: premature convergence of the mor-phology (compared to the convergence point of optimizing controllers), and discuss how this finding fits as a symptom of the proposed problem. We hope that this improved under-standing of the fundamental problem domain will open the door for further scalability of evolved agents, and note that early findings from our future work point in that direction.},

abstract = {In 1994 Karl Sims showed that computational evolution can produce interesting morphologies that resemble natural organisms. Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity is that most work, including Sims', evolves morphologies composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have been overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as more materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increased with di↵erent cost functions without stifling performance, and that organisms can be evolved at di↵erent levels of resolution. These findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPNencoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversityencouraging techniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.},

Starting from this observation, we propose a new approach to the generation of real robots, strongly inspired by living systems. Our robots are composed of tens of specialized cells, grown from a single cell using a bio-inspired virtual developmental process. Virtual cells, controlled by gene regulatory networks, divide, migrate, and specialize to produce the robot's body plan (morphology), and then the robot is manually built from this plan. Because the robot is as easy to assemble as Lego, the building process could be easily automated.},

It investigates trends in A-Life that have led to a predominance of simulations incorporating artificial evolution acting on generic agents, but lacking a level of detail that would allow the emergence of phenomena relating to the transfer and transformation of energy and matter between the virtual abiotic environment and biota. Implications of these characteristics for the relevance of A-Life's virtual ecosystem models to Ecology are discussed. We argue a position that the inclusion of low-level representations of energetics, matter and evolution, in concert with pattern-oriented modelling techniques from Ecology for model validation, will improve the relevance of A-Life models to Ecology. We also suggest two methods that may allows us to meet this goal: artificial evolution can be employed as a mechanism for automating pattern-oriented ecological modelling from the level of individual species up to that of the ecosystem, or it may be employed to explore general principles of ecosystem behaviour over evolutionary time periods.},

abstract = {Virtual creatures play an increasingly important role in computer graphics as special effects and background characters. The artificial evolution of such creatures potentially offers some relief from the difficult and time consuming task of specifying morphologies and behaviors. But, while artificial life techniques have been used to create a variety of virtual creatures, previous work has not scaled beyond creatures with 50 components and the most recent work has generated creatures that are unnatural looking. Here we describe a system that uses Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) as the encoding of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) for creating virtual creatures. Creatures evolved by this system have hundreds of parts, and the use of an L-system as the encoding results in creatures with a more natural look. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {"Art" + "Life" = Artificial Life: Life made by Man rather than by Nature. Our technological capabilities have brought us to the point where we are on the verge of creating "living" artifacts. The field of Artificial Life is devoted to studying the scientific, technological, artistic, philosophical, and social implications of such an accomplishment. 1 THE BIOLOGY OF POSSIBLE LIFE Biology is the scientific study of life — in principle anyway. In practice, biology is the scientific study of life on Earth based on carbon-chain chemistry. There is nothing in its charter that restricts biology to carbon-based life; it is simply that this is the only kind of life that has been available to study. Thus, theoretical biology has long faced the fundamental obstacle that it is impossible to derive general principles from single examples. Without other examples, it is difficult to distinguish essential properties of life-properties that would be shared by any living system — from properties that may be incidental to life in principle, but which happen to be universal to life on Earth due solely to a combination of local historical accident and common genetic descent. In order to derive general theories about life, we need an ensemble of instances to generalize over. Since it is quite unlikely that alien life forms will present themselves to us for study in the near future, our only option is to try to create alternative life-forms ourselves — Artificial Life — literally "life made by Man rather than by Nature".},

However, few coevolutionary experiments have been reported. Here we describe the results of our experiments on the evolution of physical combat among virtual creatures: essentially, we evolve creatures that trade blows with each other. While several authors have involved highly abstract forms of “combat” in their systems, this is (to our knowledge) the first example of realistic physical combat between virtual creatures, based on actual contact and physical damage. This poses the question of apportioning damage in a collision. Our solution is to assign damage proportionally to how much each colliding limb contributed to the occurrence and depth of the collision. Our system successfully evolves a wide range of morphologies and fighting behaviours, which we describe visually and verbally. As with our previous efforts, our source code is publicly available.},

abstract = {Complex artificial life simulations can yield substantially dis-tinct populations of agents corresponding to different adap-tations to a common environment or specialized adaptations to different environments. Here we show how a standard clustering algorithm applied to the artificial genomes of such agents can be used to discover and characterize these sub-populations. As gene changes propagate throughout the pop-ulation, new subpopulations are produced, which show up as new clusters. Cluster centroids allow us to characterize these different subpopulations and identify their distinct adaptation mechanisms. We suggest these subpopulations may reason-ably be thought of as species, even if the simulation soft-ware allows interbreeding between members of the different subpopulations, and provide evidence of both sympatric and allopatric speciation in the Polyworld artificial life system. Analyzing intra-and inter-cluster fecundity differences and offspring production rates suggests that speciation is being promoted by a combination of post-zygotic selection (lower fitness of hybrid offspring) and pre-zygotic selection (assor-tative mating), which may be fostered by reinforcement (the Wallace effect).},

abstract = {A common idiom in biology education states, "Eyes in the front, the animal hunts. Eyes on the side, the animal hides." In this paper, we explore one possible explanation for why predators tend to have forward-facing, high-acuity visual systems. We do so using an agent-based computational model of evolution, where predators and prey interact and adapt their behavior and morphology to one another over successive generations of evolution. In this model, we observe a coevolutionary cycle between prey swarming behavior and the predator's visual system, where the predator and prey continually adapt their visual system and behavior, respectively, over evolutionary time in reaction to one another due to the well-known "predator confusion effect." Furthermore, we provide evidence that the predator visual system is what drives this coevolutionary cycle, and suggest that the cycle could be closed if the predator evolves a hybrid visual system capable of narrow, high-acuity vision for tracking prey as well as broad, coarse vision for prey discovery. Thus, the conflicting demands imposed on a predator's visual system by the predator confusion effect could have led to the evolution of complex eyes in many predators.},

@article{Pichler2008,
abstract = {Virtual ecosystems, where natural selection is used to evolve complex agent behavior, are often preferred to traditional genetic algorithms because the absence of an explicitly defined fitness allows for a less constrained evolutionary process. However, these model ecosystems typically pre-specify a discrete set of possible action primitives the agents can perform. We think that this also constrains the evolutionary process with the modellers preconceptions of what possible solutions could be. Therefore, we propose an ecosystem model to evolve complete agents where all higher-level behavior results strictly from the interplay between extremely simple components and where no 'behavior primitives' are defined. On the basis of four distinct survival strategies we show that such primitives are not necessary to evolve behavioral diversity even in a simple and homogeneous environment. {\textcopyright} 2007 alifexi.org.},

Realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. The morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. The genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. When simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strate- gies and counter-strategies emerge.},

Traditionally, species has been considered as a basic category of biological classification and defined as a group of similar organisms showing the same essence which is based on typological species concept (essentialism). Later on, in the eighteenth century, the typological species definition was found inappropriate for biological species so mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century an entirely new species concept (biological species concept) was developed which was elaborated in detail by Mayr and Dobzhansky in the twentieth century. Biological species concept is the most widely accepted species concept. There are a large number of species concepts proposed from time to time by various naturalists, taxonomists and evolutionists which define species in different manner. There are various models to explain the modes of speci- ation basically based on geographic component such as sympatric, allopatric (dichopatric and peripatric) and parapatric. Further, chromosomal models have also been suggested to explain the modes of speciation.},

abstract = {In most modern video games, character behavior is scripted; no matter how many times the player exploits a weakness, that weakness is never repaired. Yet if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve during gameplay, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (rt- NEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible a new genre of video games in which the player teaches a team of agents through a series of customized training exercises. In order to demonstrate this concept in the (NERO) game, the player trains a team of robots for combat. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and also demonstrates how multiple agents can evolve and adapt in video games like NERO in real time using rtNEAT. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications that adapt online as the user gains new skills.},

abstract = {The ventral visual pathway implements object recognition and categorization in a hierarchy of processing areas with neuronal selectivities of increasing complexity. The presence of massive feedback connections within this hierarchy raises the possibility that normal visual processing relies on the use of computational loops. It is not known, however, whether object recognition can be performed at all without such loops (i.e., in a purely feed-forward mode). By analyzing the time course of reaction times in a masked natural scene categorization paradigm, we show that the human visual system can generate selective motor responses based on a single feed-forward pass. We confirm these results using a more constrained letter discrimination task, in which the rapid succession of a target and mask is actually perceived as a distractor. We show that a masked stimulus presented for only 26 msecand often not consciously perceivedcan fully determine the earliest selective motor responses: The neural representations of the stimulus and mask are thus kept separated during a short period corresponding to the feedforward sweep. Therefore, feedback loops do not appear to be mandatory for visual processing. Rather, we found that such loops allow the masked stimulus to reverberate in the visual system and affect behavior for nearly 150 msec after the feed-forward sweep.},

abstract = {Proposes a TD (temporal difference) and GA (genetic algorithm) based reinforcement (TDGAR) neural learning scheme for controlling chaotic dynamical systems based on the technique of small perturbations. The TDGAR learning scheme is a new hybrid GA, which integrates the TD prediction method and the GA to fulfil the reinforcement learning task. Structurally, the TDGAR learning system is composed of two integrated feedforward networks. One neural network acts as a critic network for helping the learning of the other network, the action network, which determines the outputs (actions) of the TDGAR learning system. Using the TD prediction method, the critic network can predict the external reinforcement signal and provide a more informative internal reinforcement signal to the action network. The action network uses the GA to adapt itself according to the internal reinforcement signal. This can usually accelerate the GA learning since an external reinforcement signal may only be available at a time long after a sequence of actions have occurred in the reinforcement learning problems. By defining a simple external reinforcement signal. the TDGAR learning system can learn to produce a series of small perturbations to convert chaotic oscillations of a chaotic system into desired regular ones with a periodic behavior. The proposed method is an adaptive search for the optimum control technique. Computer simulations on controlling two chaotic systems, i.e., the Henon map and the logistic map, have been conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.},

abstract = {At standard weather stations the routine weather records usually available are air temperature, T (°C), solar radiation RS(MJ/m2/d), relative humidity, RH (%), and wind velocity, u (m/s). A simple algebraic formula, equivalent in accuracy to the Penman equation is derived for computing evaporation from readily available measured data. The derivation of the formula is based on simplifications made to the "standardized" form of the Penman equation. The two components of the standard Penman equation (radiation and aerodynamic) were computed indirectly from the available routine weather data using the standardized calculation procedure recommended by Shuttleworth [Shuttleworth, W.J., 1993. In: Maidment, D.R. (Ed.), Evaporation, McGraw-Hill, New York, pp. 4.1-4.53 (Chapter 4)] and Allen et al. [Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., 1998. Crop evapotranspiration: guidelines for computing crop water requirements. FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper, 56, Rome, 300 pp]. In addition, another, more simplified formula, easy to use for routine hydrologic applications, is also developed. On the other hand, at many places reliable wind speed data are rarely available. For such cases, an expression, which does not require wind speed data, is proposed. The simplified formula for the Penman equation proposed to estimate potential evaporation from open-water without recourse to wind data is EPEN≈ 0.047 RSsqrt(T + 9.5) - 2.4 (RS/ RA)2+ 0.09 (T + 20) (1 - RH / 100) where RA(MJ/m2/d) is the extraterrestrial radiation. A simplified expression for the calculation of RAis also given. The simplicity of the formulas is demonstrated in a computational example applied for monthly climatic data. The performance of the new derived formulas was tested under various climatic conditions using a global climatic data set including monthly data as well as daily data obtained from a weather station. The new open water evaporation formulas were also adapted for calculating reference crop evapotranspiration. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Most significant is the aspect of sexual selection - where mate choice is a factor in the evolution of morphology and motor control in physically based animated organisms. We see in the examples of deer antlers, peacock tails, and fish coloration a magnificent world of variation that makes the study of animals fascinating for us - aesthetically-driven humans that we are. But aesthetics is in the eye of the beholder. And sometimes aesthetics can run counter to the rules of basic survival.

abstract = {Heat stress due to increased temperature is an agricultural problem in many areas in the world. Transitory or constantly high temperatures cause an array of morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes in plants, which affect plant growth and development and may lead to a drastic reduction in economic yield. The adverse effects of heat stress can be mitigated by developing crop plants with improved thermotolerance using various genetic approaches. For this purpose, however, a thorough understanding of physiological responses of plants to high temperature, mechanisms of heat tolerance and possible strategies for improving crop thermotolerance is imperative. Heat stress affects plant growth throughout its ontogeny, though heat-threshold level varies considerably at different developmental stages. For instance, during seed germination, high temperature may slow down or totally inhibit germination, depending on plant species and the intensity of the stress. At later stages, high temperature may adversely affect photosynthesis, respiration, water relations and membrane stability, and also modulate levels of hormones and primary and secondary metabolites. Furthermore, throughout plant ontogeny, enhanced expression of a variety of heat shock proteins, other stress-related proteins, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) constitute major plant responses to heat stress. In order to cope with heat stress, plants implement various mechanisms, including maintenance of membrane stability, scavenging of ROS, production of antioxidants, accumulation and adjustment of compatible solutes, induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) cascades, and, most importantly, chaperone signaling and transcriptional activation. All these mechanisms, which are regulated at the molecular level, enable plants to thrive under heat stress. Based on a complete understanding of such mechanisms, potential genetic strategies to improve plant heat-stress tolerance include traditional and contemporary molecular breeding protocols and transgenic approaches. While there are a few examples of plants with improved heat tolerance through the use of traditional breeding protocols, the success of genetic transformation approach has been thus far limited. The latter is due to limited knowledge and availability of genes with known effects on plant heat-stress tolerance, though these may not be insurmountable in future. In addition to genetic approaches, crop heat tolerance can be enhanced by preconditioning of plants under different environmental stresses or exogenous application of osmoprotectants such as glycinebetaine and proline. Acquiring thermotolerance is an active process by which considerable amounts of plant resources are diverted to structural and functional maintenance to escape damages caused by heat stress. Although biochemical and molecular aspects of thermotolerance in plants are relatively well understood, further studies focused on phenotypic flexibility and assimilate partitioning under heat stress and factors modulating crop heat tolerance are imperative. Such studies combined with genetic approaches to identify and map genes (or QTLs) conferring thermotolerance will not only facilitate marker-assisted breeding for heat tolerance but also pave the way for cloning and characterization of underlying genetic factors which could be useful for engineering plants with improved heat tolerance. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

At the global scale responses to extreme minimum temperatures and to the hydrological budget effectively predict the distribution limits of the major vegetation types of the World. A minimum temperature of -15C, for example, appears critical in controlling the poleward spread of vegetation that is dominated by evergreen broadleaved species; however, the presence or absence of more frost resistant species, such as those that are deciduous broadleaved, is not obviously explained in terms of extremes of climate. In such cases, predicting the competitive relationships between species is necessary and dependent on the climatic sensitivity of population dynamics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physiological and architectural plant models have originally been developed for different purposes and therefore have little in common, thus making combined applications difficult. There is, however, an increasing demand for crop models that simulate the genetic and resource-dependent variability of plant geometry and architecture, because man is increasingly able to transform plant production systems through combined genetic and environmental engineering. MODEL: GREENLAB is presented, a mathematical plant model that simulates interactions between plant structure and function. Dual-scale automaton is used to simulate plant organogenesis from germination to maturity on the basis of organogenetic growth cycles that have constant thermal time. Plant fresh biomass production is computed from transpiration, assuming transpiration efficiency to be constant and atmospheric demand to be the driving force, under non-limiting water supply. The fresh biomass is then distributed among expanding organs according to their relative demand. Demand for organ growth is estimated from allometric relationships (e.g. leaf surface to weight ratios) and kinetics of potential growth rate for each organ type. These are obtained through parameter optimization against empirical, morphological data sets by running the model in inverted mode. Potential growth rates are then used as estimates of relative sink strength in the model. These and other 'hidden' plant parameters are calibrated using the non-linear, least-square method. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The model reproduced accurately the dynamics of plant growth, architecture and geometry of various annual and woody plants, enabling 3D visualization. It was also able to simulate the variability of leaf size on the plant and compensatory growth following pruning, as a result of internal competition for resources. The potential of the model's underlying concepts to predict the plant's phenotypic plasticity is discussed.},

abstract = {Finding useful patterns in large datasets has attracted considerable interest recently, and one of the most widely studied problems in this area is the identification of clusters, or densely populated regions, in a multi-dimensional dataset. Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named {BIRCH} (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. {BIRCH} incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). {BIRCH} can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. {BIRCH} is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate {BIRCH}'s time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of {BIRCH} versus {CLARANS}, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that {BIRCH} is consistently superior.},
